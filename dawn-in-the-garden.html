<h4>Hi.</h4>
<p>This is a digital garden associated with <a href="https://moldman.studio/">Moldman Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Moldman Studio creates videos and you can see some finished works at the
studio website. The garden is a place for unfinished works, half-formed ideas,
random notes, and the like. The articles here are in various states of completeness.
This is a place of exploration and it's going to be a bit messy.</p>
<h4>The Journey So Far</h4>
<p>For many years now I've been making abstract digital art images. I start with a
photo and I digitally manipulate it until it's "done." The process of creating
them is somehow soothing and I enjoy it, but lately I've been looking for ways
to breathe some life into them. I want them to go beyond static images and
create things with some vitality and movement.</p>
<p>For various reasons (maybe a post for another day?) I'm going to be using
<a href="https://resolume.com/">Resolume</a> for this. Resolume does a good job of syncing visuals
with music out of the box and, after trying some various options, it seemed like
the quickest way to get results I liked. I'm comfortable writing code, so the
world of creative coding also seemed like a good fit. The hope is that I'll eventually
get to explore that world deeply starting with <a href="https://resolume.com/software/wire">Resolume Wire</a>.
But I'm not too picky. Anything that I can use to give my images some movement
is on the table.</p>
<p>Recently I was inspired to perform this exploration in public when I came across the
idea of <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital gardens</a>. I've never
been much of a writer and having a blog never really appealed to me, but maybe I
could curate some ideas and resources that might help someone else along the way.
And maybe showing my work will prompt some feedback from folks who know the
terrain.</p>
<p>Let's get to it...</p>
