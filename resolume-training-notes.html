<hr>
<p>I recently reviewed the <a href="https://resolume.com/training">Resolume Training</a> pages. These
are a few notes on things I found relevant or want to explore further:</p>
<h3>Compositions</h3>
<p>This panel contains compositions you've saved that you can easily import into the current composition. It imports all the clips and layers from the saved composition.</p>
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>These are sources that generate content as opposed to things like video files and images that just play back pre-recorded content.
Sources includes things like video input and generative plug-ins. You can create your own sources with <a href="https://resolume.com/software/wire">Resolume Wire</a>.</p>
