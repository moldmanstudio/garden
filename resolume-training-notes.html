<hr>
<p>I recently reviewed the <a href="https://resolume.com/training">Resolume Training</a> pages. These
are a few notes on things I found relevant or want to explore further:</p>
<h3>Compositions</h3>
<p>This panel contains compositions you've saved that you can easily import into the current composition. It imports all the clips and layers from the saved composition.</p>
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>These are sources that generate content as opposed to things like video files and images that just play back pre-recorded content.
Sources includes things like video input and generative plug-ins. You can create your own sources with <a href="https://resolume.com/software/wire">Resolume Wire</a>.</p>

<h3>Rhythm</h3>
<p>Some basic concepts about clip playback that can help you sync up visuals to the rhythm of the music:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Clip &gt; Transport panel gives you control over how a clip is played. You can play in various modes (loop, bounce, etc.), and limit the playback to a certain section of the clip.</li>
<li>The Clip &gt; Cuepoints panel lets you set cues on the clip that you can use to trigger the clip from that point.</li>
<li>On the right side of the Clip &gt; Transport panel, you can choose Timeline or BPM sync. Choose BPM sync to match clip playback to the composition BPM.</li>
<li>Click the gear to the left of a parameter to choose what is driving its animation. You can sync to BPM or Internal/External FFT to sync with audio.</li>
<li>Right click on a clip and choose Trigger Style &gt; Piano to allow triggering clips by clicking and holding (or using a keyboard shortcut/MIDI controller).</li>
<li>Right click on a clip and choose Target &gt; Free Layer. This will play the clip on a free layer, allowing you to trigger multiple clips at once. This can be useful in Piano trigger mode.</li>
</ul>
