<hr>
<p>One of the first ideas I had around <a href="https://moldmanstudio.github.io/garden/dawn-in-the-garden.html">breathing some life into my static images</a>
is to make an image that slowly scrolls forever. This should be a pretty basic
test run with plenty of room for expansion down the road.</p>
<p>In previous attempts at this idea, I've used creative coding frameworks like
<a href="https://libcinder.org/">Cinder</a>. In this case I was able to move the image
programatically and then detect when it was approaching the end. At that point
I would begin to fade it out while beginnning to fade in the next image. 
Things will need to be handled a bit differently in Resolume, I think. I'm not
sure yet how to detect that the image is approaching the edge and is about to
be repeated, for example. My hunch is that I need to just let it cycle around
and repeat, but hide the cutoff somehow, maybe using a layer mask so that the
image is fully transparent at the time it repeats.</p>
